    "The tiniest blockchain was extremely simple, and it was relatively easy to make. But, with its simplicity came a few flaws. First, SnakeCoin only ran on one single machine, so it was far from distributed, let alone decentralized. Second, blocks could be added to the chain as fast as the host computer could create a Python object and add it to a list. In the case of a simple blockchain, that’s not a problem, but we’re now going to let SnakeCoin be an actual cryptocurrency so we’ll need control the amount of blocks (and coins) that can be created at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on, SnakeCoin’s data will be transactions, so each block’s data field will be a list of some transactions. We’ll define a transaction as follows. Each transaction will be a JSON object detailing the sender of the coin, the receiver of the coin, and the amount of SnakeCoin that is being transferred. Note: Transactions are in JSON format for a reason I’ll detail shortly.\n",

    "  \"amount\": 3\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know what our transactions will look like, we need a way to add them to one of the computers in our blockchain network, called a node. To do that, we’ll create a simple HTTP server so that any user can let our nodes know that a new transaction has occurred. A node will be able to accept a POST request with a transaction (like above) as the request body. This is why transactions are JSON formatted; we need them to be transmitted to our server in a request body.\n",

    "Now, we can control the number of blocks mined in a certain time period, and we can issue new coins for people in the network to send to each other. But like we said, we’re only doing this on one computer. If blockchains are decentralized, how do we make sure that the same chain is on every node? To do this, we make each node broadcast its version of the chain to the others and allow them to receive the chains of other nodes. After that, each node has to verify the other nodes’ chains so that the every node in the network can come to a consensus of what the resulting blockchain will look like. This is called a consensus algorithm.\n",
